Version 1.1.0

* Added "SpawnDwellerFleets" command
  - Spawns Shrouded Dweller manifestations that match how they normally spawn
* Added "SpawnThreatFleets" command
  - Spawns Threat fleets that largely match how they normally spawn
  - Fleet composition based on the specified abyssal depth and the number of Second/Third Strike fleets present in-system
  - Can only be run while the player is in a star system
* Modified 1-100x speed up option for main menu missions to consistently ensure battle fidelity
  - Thanks to Dark.Revenant for the code!
* "InitiateFleetTest" command now automatically runs the "AllBlueprints" command



Version 1.0.0 (Update for Starsector 0.98a)

* Compiled for Java 17
* Updated "ShowFleetStats" XP calculations to account for the vanilla XP bugfix



Version 0.8.1

* Updated "SpawnFactionFleets" command
  - "fp" argument now accepts floating-point values
  - Added 'i' option to ignore market fleet size multiplier when spawning fleets
  - Added 'o' option to make fleets spawn without officers
  - Added "qualityOverride" argument to override market ship quality
* Updated "ShowFleetStats"
  - Now shows officer levels and counts
  - Now shows flight deck counts as well as fighter wings types and counts



Version 0.8.0

* Added "SpawnFactionFleets" command
  - Spawns a number of faction fleets using their best faction market or, if they have no markets, a fake (good) market
  - Also supports options like printing the spawned fleets' aggregated stats and composition data
* "ShowFleetStats" now also displays the following:
  - Average max CR
  - Total officers
  - Average d-mod count
  - Total frigates/destroyers/cruisers/capitals
  - Auto-resolve strength (similar to effective strength, except civilian ships count for far less)
* Updated "ShowFleetComposition" command
  - Now shows faction and hull IDs rather than their display names
  - No longer considers (D) hulls as separate hulls; they will simply be grouped with their pristine versions
  - Also displays for each hull the percentage of the hull count divided by the total number of ships
* "ShowPlayerDMods" now shows hull IDs instead of the display name
* Some code refactors



Version 0.7.1

* Added to the main menu mission descriptions a note regarding officer generation for certain factions
* Minor code refactors



Version 0.7.0

* Added 2 main menu missions
  - Inspired by the Station Tester mission from Dark.Revenant's Interstellar Imperium mod
  - First mission is a fleet vs. fleet battle for testing faction strength relative to another
  - Second mission is a station vs. fleet battle for testing station strength
  - Adding factions/stations to the missions can be done via mergeable .csv files in AFleetTestingMod/data/config/afleettestingmodConfig
* Moved all Console Commands code to compiled source folder



Version 0.6.0

* Added 6 Target Practice-esque variants of vanilla ships to the simulator
  - Inspired by Tartiflette's Target Practice mod
  - Similar to Target Practice's cubes, these ships cannot move and are teleported to the map center for easier testing
* Removed dependency on Console Commands (although it is still a major part of this mod)
