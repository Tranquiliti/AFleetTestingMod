Version 0.6.0

  - Inspired by Tartiflette's Target Practice mod

* Adjusted the Remnant test bounties
  - Adjusted fleet/ship skills to account for 0.97 Remnant skills changes
  - Now no longer appears unless the "InitiateFleetTest" command is executed (i.e. no more test bounties during normal gameplay).
